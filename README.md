# Fall_Detection
Fall Detection System using Federated Learning : 
This system combines the power of federated learning, which allows the model to be trained on decentralized data from 15 clients. Python, along with libraries like Flower, can be used to implement this system effectively. Below is a description of this system:

## System Architecture:
### Clients:

Each client represents a participant equipped with various sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.) to collect data.

### Server:

The server acts as the central coordinator for federated learning.
It initiates and manages the federated learning process.
The server hosts the global machine learning model, which is initially trained with a basic model and fine-tuned through federated learning rounds.

## Workflow:

* Federated Learning Initialization:

The server initializes the global machine learning model with a basic fall detection algorithm.
Clients are connected to the server and register themselves as participants in federated learning.

* Federated Learning Rounds:

Federated learning consists of multiple rounds.
In each round, the server:
Sends the current global model to all clients.
Clients train the model locally on their data while keeping it private.
Clients only share model updates (gradients) with the server, not raw data.
The server aggregates these updates to improve the global model.

Libraries and Technologies:
Python: The primary programming language for implementing the system and its components.
Flower: A federated learning framework in Python for connecting clients and coordinating federated learning rounds.

Data Privacy and Security:
Federated learning ensures that client data remains on the wearable devices and is not shared directly with the server, preserving user privacy.
Secure communication protocols and encryption techniques are used to protect data during transmission between clients and the server.
User consent and data anonymization techniques are implemented to further enhance privacy.
